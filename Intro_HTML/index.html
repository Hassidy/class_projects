        <h2>Why Cats are Awesome</h2>
        <p> Cats are very affectionate, playful, and adventures animals. They make up the perfect household pet. Cats will play with you when your playful and will curl up on you when your tired. Cats are warm as well and act as a little fuzzy heating pad. Cats come in all shapes and sizes. They can be short haired, long haired, or no hair at all. Even if you are allergic to cats there are still some feline friends who are hypoallergenic. If you desire a cat who wants to go on hikes, they exist! If you want to sleep all day, most cats love just doing that! Cats are the superior pet.</p>

        <h3>Cats are Easy to Manage</h3>

        <p> Cats do not really need human companionship, it is more just fun for them. Cats can handle themselves as long as you supply them with their necessities. Unlike dogs, cats do not need walks or to be taken outside to use the bathroom. Cats just need scratches, food, water, and sleep; that is how you make a cat happy. Cats live their own lives and once you come home from a long day at work your cat will be there waiting to warm you in your sleep and to receive head scratches. While your cat is simple and easy to take care of it can also help your mental health!</p>
