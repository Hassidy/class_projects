 <h2>Coffee is Inclusive</h2>
        <p>Coffee is considered inclusive because it offers something for everyone, regardless of taste, culture, or budget. With countless brewing methods, flavors, and preparation styles, people can customize their coffee exactly how they like it—from bold espresso to sweet iced drinks or caffeine-free options. Coffee shops often serve as welcoming community spaces where people of all backgrounds can gather, work, or relax. Whether enjoyed at home or in a café, coffee brings people together and fits seamlessly into a wide range of lifestyles and traditions.</p>
