        <h2>Original Coffee Forms</h2>
        <p>The original forms of coffee were simple, rustic preparations that highlight how people first discovered and enjoyed the plant. Early coffee drinkers in Ethiopia are believed to have consumed coffee cherries by chewing them or mixing them with animal fat to create an energizing paste. As coffee culture spread to Yemen, people began roasting and brewing the beans to make a drink called *qahwa*, which is considered one of the first true coffee beverages. These early forms laid the foundation for the many brewing methods and traditions that would develop around the world.</p>

    <h3>Modern Forms Of Coffee</h3>
    <p>Modern-day coffee comes in a wide variety of forms, reflecting both innovation and global tastes. Espresso-based drinks like lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos dominate cafés, while drip coffee and single-serve pod machines remain popular at home. Cold brew and iced coffee offer smoother, refreshing alternatives, and specialty methods like pour-over, Aeropress, and siphon brewing appeal to enthusiasts seeking precision and flavor control.
