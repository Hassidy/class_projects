 <h2>Oil Painting</h2>
        <p>Oil painting is one of the most forgiving art forms. This is the reason I enjoy it so much. Oil painting does require a lot of supplies, time, and effort. There are many things that are different about oil painting and acrylic. Oil paintings, on the one hand, can take about 6 months to fully dry, but during those 6 months, you can touch them up if you feel the need. Oil paints can not be used straight out of the tube. You need gesso in order to thin out the paint and be able to put it on the canvas. Oil paint does not clean easily, so it is necessary to have a certain set of paint brushes for oil painting. The only way to clean said brushes after use is with gesso. Another fun fact is that oil paint is so absorbent that it can not be used on a plastic palette; most people use glass, such as I, as their palette.</p>

    <h3>Pastels</h3>
    <p>Pastels can be referred to as glorified crayons. Pastels are more blendable than crayons and can achieve certain effects by layering different colors. Pastels are one of my favorite mediums; I am no good with them, but they are fun. You may use them on paper and canvas. They are simple to use and don't require many supplies. All you need is a palette of pastels, a paper towel or some other blending object, and your choice of canvas. All you need to do is stroke one of the pastels on the canvas, and you can simply grab the paper towel to blend it. Pastels are a medium that is used and layered to achieve beautiful depictions of art.</p>
